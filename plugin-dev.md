# Get Started

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to plugin development in Flow Launcher.

## Types of plugin implementation

While Flow Launcher is written in C#, plugins can be written natively or in other languages.

### Natively (no intergration needed)

- [**C# (.NET framework)**](/develop-dotnet-plugins.md)

### Using JSON-RPC

For other languages, Flow launcher communicates with the plugin via [JSON-RPC](/json-rpc.md).

Currently supported languages are:

- [**Python**](/py-develop-plugins.md)
- [**JavaScript / TypeScript (NodeJS)**](/nodejs-develop-plugins.md)
